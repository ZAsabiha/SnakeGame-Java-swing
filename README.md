This project is a classic Snake Game implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game features multiple levels with increasing difficulty, sound effects, and background music to enhance the gaming experience.
Multiple Levels: The game consists of three levels, each with increasing difficulty.
Dynamic Snake: The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
Scoring System: Different food items provide different points.
Sound Effects and Music: Background music and sound effects for actions like eating food and completing a level.
Collision Detection: Detection for both self-collisions and wall collisions to end the game.
Usage
Run the GamePanel class to start the game.
Use the arrow keys to control the snake:
Up Arrow: Move up
Down Arrow: Move down
Left Arrow: Move left
Right Arrow: Move right
Levels
Level 1: Initial speed and snake length, basic difficulty.
Level 2: Increased speed and snake length, moderate difficulty.
Level 3: Higher speed and snake length, challenging difficulty.
Complete all levels to win the game.
Sounds and Music
Background Music: Plays continuously during gameplay.
Sound Effects: Play when the snake eats food and when a level is completed.
